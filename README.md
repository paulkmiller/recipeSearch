# Vue Meal Search

I'm tired of thinking when it comes to making dinner. I have ingredients and I want to make something, because I am hungry, not because I like thinking. To this end, I'll utilize a free API from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and make this little app in Vue. I want to be able to search ingredients via recipe name or ingredients and be recommended how to make it or what to make. Simple enough.
