# Recipe Search using MealDb

I'm tired of thinking when it comes to making dinner. I have ingredients and I want to make something, because I am hungry, not because I like thinking. To this end, I'll utilize a free API from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and make this little app in Vue. I want to be able to search recipes via name or ingredients and be instructed on how to make a given recipe in an easily readable and accessible format.

I used [MidJourney AI](https://www.midjourney.com/) to generate designs that I used as styleguides for this project. To do that, I felt Tialwind and other bootstrapped frameworked were too limited in their malleability, so I went with custom styling throughout the project.
