# Recipe Search using MealDb

I'm tired of thinking when it comes to making dinner. I have ingredients and I want to make something, because I am hungry, not because I like thinking. To this end, I'll utilize a free API from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and make this little app in Vue. I want to be able to search ingredients via recipe name or ingredients and be recommended how to make it or what to make. Simple enough. 

As I've developed this project, I'm realizing free API's are incredibly limited. Who would have guessed. Open to suggestions for other API's I can use that provides more data than what themealdb provides.
